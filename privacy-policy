There is anonymized information taken using the official Google Analytics SDK and platform. This collected data will be used for the developer to better optimize the tool based on historically poor hands, and also improve the workflow of this app. Nothing will be traceable to your actions, and this data is analyzed in bulk. This only collects data and sends it to the developer if you opt in.
